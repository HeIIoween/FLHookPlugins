# Ship Pass (FLHookPlugin v3 vc14)
----
This is a Ship Password plugin that allows individual ships/characters on an account to be password protected. There needs to be a master password and a user password (like Pob admin). The master password is used to change the user password. The user password is used to unlock the char/ship. It is then locked when it is next loged and will have to be unlocked again by another char to be loged. Must be loged on the char you wish to set passwords on, can be on any char to unlock.

/setmasterpass <char> <masterpass>\
/setuserpass <char> <userpass> <masterpass>\
/unlockchar <char> <userpass>

just a quickie, and probably badly written; expect bugs and such. Feel free to submit an issue.
