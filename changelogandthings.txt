===========================================
bounty tracker - todo:
bounty add method-> cfg writer mini json?
    also timed protection. (how?)
    add a minimum required player level to adda  bounty
==========================================
things that need testing:
check can't submit bounty again same target (lastIssuer) (try to add bounty after it is completed on same target)
are checks on BTI.Char case sensitive?

plus all completed below:
please test new cfg writer. bouty is appended at end of add, it deletes the bounty in addto, modifies the string and appends it as new bounty.
also deletes bounty at the beginning of shipDestroyed, virtual bounty is updated and then appended to cfg.

=========================================
useful strings of code
(wchar_t*)Players.GetActiveCharacterName(iClientID) <- gets charname from id
=========================================
things completed latley:
check active bounty using bool BTI.active (done)
added minimum cash and max xtimes values (done)
replaced player online check with player exists check (done)
added check if player already has a bounty on them (done)
added check if player and victim were the same person (done)
the issuer of a bounty cannot claim a reward on it (done)
added individual protection (lastIssuer)(one person cant keep submitting bounties on one person) (done)
made all name strings lowercase (done)
clear bounty when completed (done)
added ability to contribute credits to raise a bounty (per remaining contracts) (done)
added player exists check to bounty view (done)
realised how to do cmds properly
added ability to use periods, commas, and scientific notation in cash amount (note: only x million is availiable e.g 2e6 = 2 mill)
finally added cfg writer. Now bounties can be save to disk! (done!) note: flserver requires admin priv to write to files. I wonder if this will cause trouble?
due to the cfg writer, the bounties are in a seperate cfg file now. any plugin settings are in the default file.(e.g plugin enable.)
