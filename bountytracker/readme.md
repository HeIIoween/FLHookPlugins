# Bounty Tracker (FLHookPlugin v3 vc14)
----
This is a bounty tracking plugin that allows hunters to be auto paid, and makes it easier for the issuer to not worry about cash transfers. 
very messy, and probably badly written; expect bugs and such. config files are not updated, any settings in config stick when server restarts / plugin is loaded. Virtual bounties work fine however.
